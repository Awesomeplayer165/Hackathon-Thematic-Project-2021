# Hackathon Thematic Project 2021

This project shows the Hackathon Thematic Project done in 2021.

## About:

The themtatic project was finance and money and I made a bank app written in Swift using UIKit for Mac Catalyst. In the future, if needed, I can improve this by using SwiftUI.

## Features:
- You can deposit and withdraw money.
- You can create an account and log in with that account to manage multiple accounts with different money amounts
  - Used some of the files that now became the [AuthenticationCheck](https://github.com/Awesomeplayer165/Authentication-Check) repository
- Uses an offline db sqlite3 

This project will not be recieving anymore updates since September 24th, 2021.
